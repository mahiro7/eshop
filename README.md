# eshop
Project of a small clothes e-shop using PHP, JavaScript, MySQL, HTML and CSS

This project is inspired in a work I did at college, Web Development Class.

# Configuring server and database
At `eshop/php_pages`, there's the db_credentials.php. Modify the variable values as you wish, do not change the variable name.

`
$servername = "localhost";
$username = "root";
$db_password = "";
$dbname = "database1";
$table_users = "db1login";
`

# Creating database
To create the database and table, use the create_table_db.php.

If the database and table were succesfully created and chose, these three phrases will be shown.

> Database created successfully
> 
> Database changed successfully
>
> Table created successfully
